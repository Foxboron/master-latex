\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis investigates how transparency log overlays can provide additional
security guarantees for rebuilders building Debian packages. In Reproducible
Builds it is important to have a set of independent and distributed systems
building packages to make sure they have not been tampered with. By putting
BUILDINFO files and in-toto link metadata on a proof-of-concept transparency log
we are capable of detecting tampering of the published logs despite the current
scaling problems. This gives users and companies additional security guarantees
in the software supply chain for Debian packages.
