\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
I would like to thank everyone in ``Pils og Programmering'' for years of moral
support, discussions and debates.

My supervisor Andreas Lothe Opdahl for his valuable support and feedback on the
thesis.

A big thank you to Santiago Torres-Arias and Lukas Puehringer from NYU Secure
System Labs for the opportunity to work on this project and valuable feedback.

I would also like to thank all the students at the Department of Information
Science and Media Studies, especially room 642, for time wasted and time spent.
